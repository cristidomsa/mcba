Server:

pip install -r requirements.txt

python app.py


USAGE:

Add users to DB: 

curl "http://localhost:8880/api?name=foo&ccy=EUR"   -   query parameters found at db/models.py

Run client:

python3 client.py

KNOWN TODOs:
- add docstrings (some comments)
- add tests
- clean code
- add paralel execution where possible


Summary: 

I hope you like and follow easily the code even thou I didn't add comments, it is my first websocket project so it took 6h to complete (including 2 of documentation). 
You can access localhost:8880 (I used an existing index.html - I'm not fast at all at UI's) 
Looking forward for your feedback, the goods, the bads and the evils included :). BTW, websockets are pretty cool (but python3 would be advised). 

Hope I didn't miss anything, but I'll be available tomorrow (on the road to the montains).

Thank you!
